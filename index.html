        <p>The old parliament architecture built in 1927 was designed by the British architects Sir Edwin Lutyens and
          Sir Herbert Baker; and it was largely influenced by Hindu Yogini Temple at Mitaoli.

          According to Bimal Patel, the architect in charge of the redesign of Central Vista, the new complex has a
          hexagonal shape. It is being built next to the existing complex and is almost equal in size to the former
          one.

          The building is designed to have a lifespan of more than 150 years. It is designed to be earthquake
          resistant and architectural styles from different parts of India are incorporated in it. The Lok Sabha and
          the Rajya Sabha chambers have large seating capacities to accommodate more members than are currently present,
          since the number of MPs may increase with India's growing population and consequent future delimitation.


          the Lok Sabha chamber in the New Parliament building
          The new complex has 888 seats in the Lok Sabha chamber and 384 seats in the Rajya Sabha chamber. Unlike the
          old parliament building, it does not have a central hall. The Lok Sabha chamber able to house 1,272 members in
          case of a joint session. The rest of the building has four floors with offices for ministers and committee
          rooms.

          The building has a built area of 20,866 square metres (224,600 sq ft) (including its open-sky area of 2,000
          square metres (22,000 sq ft) for a banyan tree), which makes it 10% smaller in size than the existing old
          circular building of 22,900 square metres (246,000 sq ft) (diameter 170.7 metres (560 ft)) including its open
          sky area of 6,060 square metres (65,200 sq ft), split into three sectors.</p>

        <p>The intensity of Cyclone Biparjoy has reduced from 'very severe' category to 'severe' after the storm made
          landfall in coastal areas of Gujarat on Thursday evening, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.
          The weather department said that the cyclone has now moved from sea to land and is centred towards
          Sauarashtra-Kutch, adding that heavy rains are expected in Rajasthan today.

          According to the latest weather bulletin from the India Meteorological Department, it will weaken gradually
          into a cyclonic storm over Saurashtra and Kutch around noon and subsequently into a deep depression around
          evening.

          The Relief Commissioner informed that 22 people got injured, while electric poles, and trees were uprooted
          amid severe heavy rains coupled with gusty winds.</p>
